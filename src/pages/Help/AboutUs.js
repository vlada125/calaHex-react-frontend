      <h2 className="text-center text-header">About Us</h2>
      <p>We have been running traditional companies for decades. Companies that have an actual 
        office, store, production facility, storage rooms and so forth. Traditional businesses who provide
        a product or service in exchange for compensation. Our companies are all active in the 
        Construction Industry, so why in the hell would we launch a Crypto and Token exchange 
        platform. The answer to that is pretty simple. We studied the ‘nuts and bolts’ of Blockchain and 
        saw some core advantages that appealed to us. Decentralization, cryptographic security, 
        transparency, and immutability. Ok, not really…..we just thought it would be super cool to do, 
        and so we did.</p>
      <h4>Our Mission</h4>
      <p>We believe that humor combined with a robust design and some creative use of technology 
        can make complicated ideas more understandable and the services we provide through 
        Calahex more fun. Our mission is to bring every adult (including grandma and grandpa) to our 
        platform, bring innovative business ideas and projects to our platform, and help others gain a 
        little bit of financial freedom in the process. </p>
      <h4>Why Calahex?</h4>
      <p>We are from the Caribbean, from a little island called Aruba, which is better known for her 
        beautiful clear ocean and white beaches than for any significant contribution to the Crypto 
        Industry. Our island is home to over 40 nationalities and host to a variety of cultures. We are 
        Caribbean, South American, American, Asian, European and the list goes on. We could not fit 
        all nationalities into one name. So we thought Calahex would be a cool name. It’s kind of 
        catchy when you repeat it over and over again. So let’s trade and remember, “don’t worry...be 
        happy!”.</p>
